The `haiku` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/haiku desc=haiku]] plugin.

This directive allows inserting a randomly generated haiku into a wiki page.
Just type:

	\[[!haiku hint="argument"]]

[[!haiku hint="argument test"]]

The hint parameter can be omitted, it only provides the generator a hint of
what to write the haiku about. If no hint is given, it might base it on the
page name. Since the vocabulary it knows is very small, many hints won't
affect the result at all.
