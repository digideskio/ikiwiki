The `brokenlinks` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/brokenlinks desc=brokenlinks]] plugin.

This directive generates a list of broken links on pages in the wiki. This is
a useful way to find pages that still need to be written, or links that
are written wrong.

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] specifying the
pages to search for broken links, default is search them all.

Example:

	\[[!brokenlinks pages="* and !recentchanges"]]

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
