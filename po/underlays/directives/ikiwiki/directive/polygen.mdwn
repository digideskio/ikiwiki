The `polygen` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/polygen desc=polygen]] plugin.

This directive allows inserting text generated by polygen into a wiki page.
For example:

	\[[!polygen grammar="genius"]]

It's also possible to specify a starting nonterminal for the grammar by
including `symbol="text"` in the directive.
