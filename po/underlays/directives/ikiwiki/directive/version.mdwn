The `version` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/version desc=version]] plugin.

This directive allows inserting the version of ikiwiki onto a page.

Whenever ikiwiki is upgraded to a new version, the page will be rebuilt,
updating the version number.

Use is simple:

	\[[!version ]]

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
