"The `aggregate` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/aggregate "
"desc=aggregate]] plugin.  This plugin requires extra setup, specifically, a "
"cron job. See the plugin's documentation for details."

"This directive allows content from other feeds to be aggregated into the "
"wiki.  Aggregate a feed as follows:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"\t\\[[!aggregate name=\"example blog\" dir=\"example\"\n"
"\tfeedurl=\"http://example.com/index.rss\"\n"

"That example aggregates posts from the specified RSS feed, updating no more "
"frequently than once every 15 minutes (though possibly less frequently, if "
"the cron job runs less frequently than that), and puts a page per post under "
"the example/ directory in the wiki."

"You can then use ikiwiki's [[inline]] directive to create a blog of one or "
"more aggregated feeds. For example:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

msgid "\t\\[[!inline pages=\"internal(example/*)\"]]\n"

"Note the use of `internal()` in the [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] to match aggregated "
"pages. By default, aggregated pages are internal pages, which prevents them "
"from showing up directly in the wiki, and so this special [[PageSpec]] is "
"needed to match them."
