The `orphans` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/orphans desc=orphans]] plugin.

This directive generates a list of possibly orphaned pages -- pages that no
other page links to. Example:

	\[[!orphans pages="* and !blog/*"]]

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] specifying the
pages to check for orphans, default is search them all.

Note that it takes backlinks into account, but does not count inlining a
page as linking to it, so will generally count many blog-type pages as
orphans.

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
