The `color` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/color desc=color]] plugin.

This directive can be used to color a piece of text on a page.
It can be used to set the foreground and/or background color of the text.

You can use a color name (e.g. `white`) or HTML code (e.g. `#ffffff`)
to define colors. 

## examples

Here the foreground color is defined as a word, while the background color
is defined as a HTML color code:

	\[[!color foreground=white background=#ff0000 text="White text on red background"]]

The background color is missing, so the text is displayed on default
background:

	\[[!color foreground=white text="White text on default color background"]]

The foreground is missing, so the text has the default foreground color:

	\[[!color background=#ff0000 text="Default color text on red background"]]
