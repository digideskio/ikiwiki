The `listdirectives` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/listdirectives desc=listdirectives]] plugin.

This directive generates a list of available
[[directives|ikiwiki/directive]].

	\[[!listdirectives]]

There is one optional keyword argument, `generated`.  Normally the
`listdirectives` directive will list all built in directives and directives
directly registered by plugins.  With this keyword, `listdirectives` will
also list directives generated later.  For example, all [[shortcuts]] are
directives generated in turn by the `shortcut` directive.  They will only
be listed if the `generated` argument is supplied.

    \[[!listdirectives generated]]

This extended list is often quite long, and often contains many
undocumented directives.
