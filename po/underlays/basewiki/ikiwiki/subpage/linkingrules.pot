"To link to or from a [[SubPage]], you can normally use a regular "
"[[WikiLink]] that does not contain the name of the parent directory of the "
"[[SubPage]]. Ikiwiki descends the directory hierarchy looking for a page "
"that matches your link."

"For example, if FooBar/SubPage links to \"OtherPage\", ikiwiki will first "
"prefer pointing the link to FooBar/SubPage/OtherPage if it exists, next to "
"FooBar/OtherPage and finally to OtherPage in the root of the wiki."

"Note that this means that if a link on FooBar/SomePage to \"OtherPage\" "
"currently links to OtherPage, in the root of the wiki, and FooBar/OtherPage "
"is created, the link will _change_ to point to FooBar/OtherPage. On the "
"other hand, a link from BazBar to \"OtherPage\" would be unchanged by this "
"creation of a [[SubPage]] of FooBar."

"You can also specify a link that contains a directory name, like "
"\"FooBar/OtherPage\" to more exactly specify what page to link to. This is "
"the only way to link to an unrelated [[SubPage]]."

"You can use this to, for example, to link from BazBar to \"FooBar/SubPage\", "
"or from BazBar/SubPage to \"FooBar/SubPage\"."

"You can also use \"/\" at the start of a link, to specify exactly which page "
"to link to, when there are multiple pages with similar names and the link "
"goes to the wrong page by default. For example, linking from "
"\"FooBar/SubPage\" to \"/OtherPage\" will link to the \"OtherPage\" in the "
"root of the wiki, even if there is a \"FooBar/OtherPage\"."

"Also, if the wiki is configured with a userdir, you can link to pages within "
"the userdir without specifying a path to them. This is to allow for easy "
"linking to a user's page in the userdir, to sign a comment. These links are "
"checked for last of all."
