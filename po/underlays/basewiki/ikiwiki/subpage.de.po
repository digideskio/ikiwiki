"ikiwiki supports placing pages in a directory hierarchy. For example, this "
"page, [[SubPage]] has some related pages placed under it, like [[SubPage/"
"LinkingRules]]. This is a useful way to add some order to your wiki rather "
"than just having a great big directory full of pages."

"To add a SubPage, just make a subdirectory and put pages in it. For example, "
"this page is SubPage.mdwn in this wiki's source, and there is also a SubPage "
"subdirectory, which contains SubPage/LinkingRules.mdwn. Subpages can be "
"nested as deeply as you'd like."
