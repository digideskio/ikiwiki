"To select a set of pages, such as pages that are locked, pages whose commit "
"emails you want subscribe to, or pages to combine into a blog, the wiki uses "
"a PageSpec. This is an expression that matches a set of pages."

"The simplest PageSpec is a simple list of pages. For example, this matches "
"any of the three listed pages:"

"More often you will want to match any pages that have a particular thing in "
"their name. You can do this using a glob pattern. \"`*`\" stands for any "
"part of a page name, and \"`?`\" for any single letter of a page name. So "
"this matches all pages about music, and any [[SubPage]]s of the SandBox, but "
"does not match the SandBox itself:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid "\t*music* or SandBox/*\n"

"You can also prefix an item with \"`!`\" to skip pages that match it. So to "
"match all pages except for Discussion pages and the SandBox:"

"Some more elaborate limits can be added to what matches using these "

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"\"`link(page)`\" - matches only pages that link to a given page (or glob)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"\"`tagged(tag)`\" - matches pages that are tagged or link to the given tag "
"(or tags matched by a glob)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid "\"`backlink(page)`\" - matches only pages that a given page links to"
msgstr ""

"\"`creation_month(month)`\" - matches only pages created on the given month"
msgstr ""

msgid "\"`creation_year(year)`\" - or year"

"\"`created_before(page)`\" - matches only pages created before the given "
"page was created"
msgstr ""

"\"`glob(someglob)`\" - matches pages that match the given glob. Just writing "
"the glob by itself is actually a shorthand for this function."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"\"`internal(glob)`\" - like `glob()`, but matches even internal-use pages "
"that globs do not usually match."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '

"\"`title(glob)`\", \"`author(glob)`\", \"`authorurl(glob)`\", \"`license"
"(glob)`\", \"`copyright(glob)`\" - match pages that have the given metadata, "
"matching the specified glob."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"\"`user(username)`\" - tests whether a modification is being made by a user "
"with the specified username. If openid is enabled, an openid can also be put "

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"\"`admin()`\" - tests whether a modification is being made by one of the "
"wiki admins."

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"\"`ip(address)`\" - tests whether a modification is being made from the "
"specified IP address."

"For example, to match all pages in a blog that link to the page about music "
"and were written in 2005:"

"Note the use of \"and\" in the above example, that means that only pages "
"that match each of the three expressions match the whole. Use \"and\" when "
"you want to combine expression like that; \"or\" when it's enough for a page "
"to match one expression. Note that it doesn't make sense to say \"index and "
"SandBox\", since no page can match both expressions."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"More complex expressions can also be created, by using parentheses for "
"grouping. For example, to match pages in a blog that are tagged with either "
"of two tags, use:"

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid "\tblog/* and (tagged(foo) or tagged(bar))\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Note that page names in PageSpecs are matched against the absolute filenames "
"of the pages in the wiki, so a pagespec \"foo\" used on page \"a/b\" will "
"not match a page named \"a/foo\" or \"a/b/foo\". To match relative to the "
"directory of the page containing the pagespec, you can use \"./\". For "
"example, \"./foo\" on page \"a/b\" matches page \"a/foo\"."
