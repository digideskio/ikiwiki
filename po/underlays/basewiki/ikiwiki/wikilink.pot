"It's also possible to write a WikiLink that uses something other than the "

"ikiwiki has two syntaxes for [[directives|directive]].  The older syntax "
"used spaces to distinguish between directives and wikilinks; as a result, "
"with that syntax in use, you cannot use spaces in WikiLinks, and must "
"replace spaces with underscores.  The newer syntax, enabled with the "
"`prefix_directives` option in an ikiwiki setup file, prefixes directives "
"with `!`, and thus does not prevent links with spaces.  Future versions of "
"ikiwiki will turn this option on by default."
