"ikiwiki also has an older syntax for directives, which requires a space in "
"directives to distinguish them from [[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]]. This "
"syntax has several disadvantages: it requires a space after directives with "
"no parameters (such as `\\[[pagecount ]]`), and it prohibits spaces in "
"[[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]].  ikiwiki now provides the `!`-prefixed "
"syntax shown above as default.  However, ikiwiki still supports wikis using "
"the older syntax, if the `prefix_directives` option is disabled."
